    "**Calculate and work with textual features beyond token unigram counts to predict volume publication dates.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to work this week with **regression** rather than classification. This means that, rather than trying to predict a class label for each text, we'll try to estimate a continuous value for each text (in this case, the date of first publication of the book). We're also going to expand our feature set beyond unigram token counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the move from classification to regression, the general `sklearn` workflow is similar. You'll still create features using a vectorizer of some sort, you'll still set up a predictor object (now a regressor rather than a classifier), you'll still fit your predictor to your feature data, and you'll still produce a vector of predictions (now in the form of numbers rather than discreet labels). You can still score and cross-validate your results, but now by measuring the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, rather than $F_1$.\n",
